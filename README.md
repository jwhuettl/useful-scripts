# Useful Scripts

this repository is for scripts that i have written to solve issues that i have come across day to day. languages will depend on use case, with an emphasis on having minimal dependencies or libraries.

#### the scripts

- [x] audio-convert (converts m4a, flac, wav to mp3 for use on legacy media players (zune / ipod))
- [x] csvtomdtb (parses a csv file to markdown table in a new file)
